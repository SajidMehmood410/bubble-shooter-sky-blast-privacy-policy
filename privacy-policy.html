    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Logcatofficial</p>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the mobile game <strong>"Bubble Nightfall: Puzzle Pop"</strong> developed by Logcatofficial. We are committed to protecting the privacy of all users, including children, and complying with all relevant privacy laws and regulations including COPPA, GDPR, and Google Play policies.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>Our app does not directly collect or store any personal or sensitive user data. However, we use third-party services such as Google AdMob to display ads, which may collect anonymous device and usage information to serve appropriate content.</p>

    <h2>2. Google AdMob and UMP SDK</h2>
    <p>We have integrated <strong>Google AdMob</strong> and the <strong>User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK</strong> to manage consent for personalized and non-personalized ads based on user location and age group.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We have enabled <strong>child-directed treatment</strong> and set the app to be <strong>under the age of consent</strong> to ensure compliance with laws protecting children’s privacy (e.g., COPPA, GDPR-K).</li>
        <li>For users in the EEA, UK, and other regions governed by privacy laws, the UMP SDK will present a consent form to obtain valid user consent for ad personalization.</li>
        <li>Users can update or withdraw consent at any time via the in-app privacy settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services that may collect limited, anonymized data to serve ads or manage user consent:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> - for displaying banner, interstitial, and rewarded ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Google User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK</strong> - for collecting and managing user consent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services may collect anonymous data such as device identifiers, IP address (for regional compliance), and interaction data for analytics and ad targeting purposes.</p>
    <p>For more information, please see <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is designed for a general audience, including children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of digital consent in your region). We have taken special care to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Set the app as child-directed and under age of consent within AdMob settings.</li>
        <li>Display only non-personalized ads to children when required.</li>
        <li>Prevent data collection that could be used to track children across apps or services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If a parent or guardian believes that we have unintentionally collected such data, please contact us, and we will promptly delete it.</p>

    <h2>5. AI-Generated Assets</h2>
    <p>Some visual elements (such as visual effects or animations) may be created with AI tools. These do not involve or process any user data.</p>

    <h2>6. Consent and Control</h2>
    <p>For users in regions requiring data consent, a consent form will be displayed at app launch. Users may:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Accept or deny personalized advertising.</li>
        <li>Access privacy options at any time from the in-app settings.</li>
        <li>Withdraw or modify consent preferences through the privacy button in the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>We do not store any personal user data directly. Any data processed by third-party services (e.g., Google AdMob) is handled according to their respective privacy policies and data retention practices.</p>

    <h2>8. Access to Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy is accessible from within the app and on the Google Play Store listing for full transparency.</p>

    <h2>9. Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our services, legal requirements, or third-party providers. Any changes will be posted on this page with a revised effective date.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
