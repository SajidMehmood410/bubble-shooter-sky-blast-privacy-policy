    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Logcatofficial</p>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the mobile game <strong>"Bubble Nightfall: Puzzle Pop"</strong> developed by Logcatofficial. We are committed to protecting the privacy of all users, including children, and complying with all relevant privacy laws and regulations such as COPPA, GDPR-K, and Google Play's Families Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>Our app does not directly collect or store any personal or sensitive user data. However, we use third-party services (such as Google AdMob) which may collect anonymized technical data solely for the purpose of serving safe, appropriate ads and managing consent.</p>

    <h2>2. Advertising and Consent</h2>
    <p>We have integrated <strong>Google AdMob</strong> and the <strong>User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK</strong> to display ads and manage user consent in accordance with international privacy regulations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We have enabled <strong>TagForChildDirectedTreatment</strong> and <strong>TagForUnderAgeOfConsent</strong> in the SDK to treat all users as underage for maximum safety.</li>
        <li>The app uses <strong>Max Ad Content Rating set to “G”</strong> to ensure only family-safe ads are shown.</li>
        <li>All ad sources used are part of Google’s <strong>Families Self-Certified Ads SDK Program</strong>.</li>
        <li>We have disabled personalized ads and tracking for children and do not transmit advertising identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID/AAID) for users identified as underage.</li>
        <li>In-app privacy options allow users to update or withdraw consent at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following services that may collect limited, anonymized data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> – for displaying family-safe banner, interstitial, and rewarded ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Google UMP SDK</strong> – for handling consent messages in line with GDPR and regional regulations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services may process non-personal data such as approximate location (for legal compliance), device type, or in-app interactions. No personally identifiable information is collected from children.</p>
    <p>For more information, visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app is designed for a general audience, including children under the age of digital consent. We do not knowingly collect, use, or share personal data from children.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ads are shown with non-personalized targeting.</li>
        <li>No identifiers such as AAID, IMEI, MAC address, or geolocation are collected from children.</li>
        <li>We ensure all ads and ad networks comply with Google Play’s Families Policy and COPPA standards.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If a parent or guardian believes that personal data has been collected from a child, they can contact us to request deletion.</p>

    <h2>5. AI-Generated Assets</h2>
    <p>Some visual effects or design elements may be AI-generated. These do not process or access any user data.</p>

    <h2>6. Consent and User Control</h2>
    <p>Consent forms are presented at app launch for users in regions governed by privacy laws. Users may:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose between personalized and non-personalized ads (when applicable).</li>
        <li>Review and update consent settings via in-app privacy options.</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent at any time using the consent button.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>We do not store any personal user data ourselves. Third-party partners handle anonymized data according to their own retention policies. No personal data from children is retained.</p>

    <h2>8. Access to Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy is available from the app’s settings menu and the Google Play Store listing.</p>

    <h2>9. Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in regulation, SDK providers, or app functionality. Changes will be published on this page with a new effective date.</p>
